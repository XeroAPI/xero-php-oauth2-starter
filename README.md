# xero-php-oauth2-starter

This is a starter app with the code to perform OAuth 2.0 authentication

You'll be able to connect to a Xero Organisation and make real API calls - we recommend you connect to the Demo company.

## Getting Started
To run locally, you'll need a local web server with PHP support.  
* MAMP is a good option [Download MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) 

### Download this code
* Clone this repo into your local server webroot. i.e. `htdocs`
* Launch a terminal app and change to the newly cloned folder `xero-php-oauth2-starter`
* Download dependencies with Composer using the following command:

```
composer install
```

## Create a Xero App
To obtain your API keys, follow these steps and create a Xero app

* Create a [free Xero user account](https://www.xero.com/us/signup/api/) (if you don't have one)
* Login to [Xero developer center](https://developer.xero.com/myapps)
* Click "New App" link
* Enter your App name, company url, privacy policy url.
* Enter the redirect URI (your callback url - i.e. `http://localhost:8888/xero-php-oauth2-starter/callback.php`)
* Agree to terms and condition and click "Create App".
* Click "Generate a secret" button.
* Copy your client id and client secret and save for use later.
* Click the "Save" button. You secret is now hidden.

## Configure API keys
You'll need to update your code where ever there is a clientId, clientSecret or redirectUri

- authorization.php
- callback.php
- authorizedResource.php

Sample PHP code from authorization.php
```php

$provider = new \League\OAuth2\Client\Provider\GenericProvider([
	'clientId'                => '__YOUR_CLIENT_ID__',,   
	'clientSecret'            => "__YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET__",
	'redirectUri'             => "__YOUR_REDIRECT_URI__",
	'urlAuthorize'            => 'https://login.xero.com/identity/connect/authorize',
	'urlAccessToken'          => 'https://identity.xero.com/connect/token',
	'urlResourceOwnerDetails' => 'https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Organisation'
]);

```
## Take it for a spin
Launch your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8888/xero-php-oauth2-starter/ (or whatever the correct path is). 

- You should see a connect to xero link.
- Click the link, login to Xero (if you aren't already)
- Grant access to your user account and select the Demo company to connect to.
- Done - try out the different API calls
